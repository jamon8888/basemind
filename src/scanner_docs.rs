//! Document-tier branch helpers for the scanner.
//!
//! Gated on `feature = "documents"`. Lives in its own file so the core
//! `src/scanner.rs` module stays under the 1000-line cap and so the
//! intelligence-only code path is easy to inspect in isolation.
//!
//! The flow that the scanner drives is:
//!
//! 1. `process_file` sees `lang::detect` return `None` (non-source file).
//! 2. `should_extract_document` decides whether the file qualifies for the
//!    document tier based on `[documents]` config + MIME allowlist.
//! 3. `extract_and_persist_doc` runs xberg, writes the msgpack blob, and
//!    returns a `PendingDocBatch` carrying only the lightweight metadata (path,
//!    blob hash, scope, counts) needed to rebuild rows later — never the
//!    embedding vectors themselves.
//! 4. The single-threaded apply pass calls `flush_document_batches`, which — per
//!    file — re-reads that file's already-persisted `.doc.msgpack` blob, builds
//!    its LanceDB rows, writes them, and drops them before moving on. Peak embed
//!    RAM is one file's rows, independent of corpus size (the streaming write
//!    that replaced the old "accumulate every file's rows, then write once" pass
//!    which held multiple GB resident on a large repo).
